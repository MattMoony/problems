# Problems
_... and solutions_

## About

One can only get better by practicing - and that's what this repository is about. It contains problems (and their solutions) in C++. I do this in order to improve both my C++ and problem solving / alogrithmic skills. 

In a best-case scenario, I will add a new problem and its solution everyday, but since I'm currently attending college that seems a little unlikely.

## References

I don't come up with most of the problems myself, here are my sources (also, do not look at my solutions if you haven't yet completed the challenge yourself, since I don't want to spoil it for you):

* [SPOJ](https://spoj.com)
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

_This list will probably grow on in the future._
